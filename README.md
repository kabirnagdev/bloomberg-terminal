A hybrid RAG system exploring how knowledge graphs, semantic search, and LLMs can answer questions about financial survey data.

### Dataset

The project uses a structured CSV dataset containing survey responses about investment preferences, savings objectives, and related financial attributes. Each row represents a record, while selected categorical values become entities in the knowledge graph.

**Note:** This is survey data, not live stock prices or financial filings.

### How It Works

1. **Load Data** — Clean the CSV and identify categorical and property columns.
2. **Build Knowledge Graph** — Connect records to entities and discover co-occurrence relationships using lift.
3. **Generate Embeddings** — Encode records, entity labels, and column names using Sentence Transformers.
4. **Process Query** — Extract keywords, match relevant entities, perform vector search, and expand through graph relationships.
5. **Build Context** — Combine retrieved records, graph relationships, and computed statistics.
6. **Generate Answer** — Pass the evidence to a Groq-hosted LLM to produce a context-grounded response.

```

### Key Capabilities

- **Knowledge Graph Construction** — Converts tabular financial survey data into interconnected records and entities.
- **Association Mining** — Discovers co-occurrence patterns using statistical lift.
- **Hybrid Retrieval** — Combines semantic vector search, entity matching, and graph traversal.
- **Contextual Question Answering** — Uses retrieved records, relationships, and computed statistics to ground LLM responses.
- **RDF Export** — Serializes graph data into Turtle format for interoperability.
- **Plain RAG Baseline** — Supports comparison with vector-only retrieval.
- **Resilient Embeddings** — Falls back to character n-gram hashing when the embedding model is unavailable.

Open `Knowledge_graph_finance_RAG_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, configure the dataset path and `GROQ_API_KEY`, and run the notebook cells.
